# Getting Started 

In order to install the necessary dependencies go to both the server folder and the client folder. 
use `npm i` to install. 


## Running the project 

In the server directory, you can run:

 `npm run dev`

this will activate both the server and client simultaneously using a package called Concurrently. 

otherwise just run server and client separately in different terminals.
